## About the Project
BoozeCTRL, is a mobile application that promotes conscientious alcohol consumption in youth (ages 18-24), by supporting them in taking control of their drinking habits.  
BoozeCTRL allows users to track their alcohol intake, set personal goals, receive feedback on their progress, and connect with a supportive community for shared experiences and encouragement. The app notifies users when they are nearing their limits (whether that be alcohol and/ or financial related) to reel them in and confront them with their consumption habits in real-time. Additional supporting features are the community feature, where users can engage in live chats and forums tailored to their specific needs, and a feed page, where they can post their progress.
